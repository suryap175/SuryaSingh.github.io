								<p>During my Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University, from September 2022 to May 2024, I acquired a comprehensive range of skills in data analytics. The program included coursework in <b>Fundamentals of Data Analytics, Computation and Visualization, Data Management for Analytics, Data and Product Design Management, Data Mining for Engineering, Statistical Learning in Engineering, and Machine Learning and Python in Finance </b>. 
									These courses equipped me with advanced capabilities in statistical analysis, data management, data mining, and machine learning. I developed expertise in creating and implementing <b>predictive models, utilizing data visualization techniques, and managing complex data sets.</b> Additionally, I served as a Teaching Assistant, where I supported students in understanding statistical modeling, data analytics concepts, and practical applications. My role involved guiding students through coursework and projects, further refining my own understanding of the material. My GPA of <b>3.87/4.0</b> reflects my strong performance and commitment to the field. 
									Outside of academics, I was actively involved in the NU Sanskriti club, a traditional cultural organization for Indian students, where I contributed to community-building activities and events, enriching my overall university experience </P>
